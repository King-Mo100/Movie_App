# Movie App

This is a simple movie app that allows users to search for movies and view details about them, such as the movie poster, rating and synopsis.
The app uses an API to fetch movie data and display it in a user-friendly way.

## Usage
To use this app, simply visit the following url in your web browser: https://king-mo100.github.io/Movie_App/ 
To search for a movie, simply enter the name of the movie in the search bar and hit enter.
The app will fetch data from the API and display a list of movies that match your search query, as you hover your mouse over the movies the synopsis would show.
